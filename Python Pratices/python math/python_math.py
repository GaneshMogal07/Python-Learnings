# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# Built-in Math Functions
# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:
    
    
import math

a = max(10,30,40)
b = min(100,555,677,4444,3333,333)
c = slice(a)
x = abs(-7.25)
z = pow(2,3)

print(x)
print(z)
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# output-
