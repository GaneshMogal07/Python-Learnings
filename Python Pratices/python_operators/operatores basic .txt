Python Operators -
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

a = 10 
b =20
c = a + b
print(c)




 # Python divides the operators in the following groups:

1.Arithmetic operators
2.Assignment operators
3.Comparison operators
4.Logical operators
5.Identity operators
6.Membership operators
7.Bitwise operators
