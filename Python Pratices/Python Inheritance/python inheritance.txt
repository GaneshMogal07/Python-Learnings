Python Inheritance â€“ Simple & Best Explanation
Inheritance in Python is an Object-Oriented Programming concept where one class (child/derived class) inherits the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (parent/base class).

âœ… Why Use Inheritance?
Code Reusability â€“ You don't have to write the same code again.
Extensibility â€“ You can extend existing functionality.
Organization â€“ Helps in creating logical class hierarchies.



ðŸ§± Basic Structure of Inheritance in Python :-

class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent class")

class Child(Parent):  # Inheriting from Parent
    def display(self):
        print("This is Child class")

# Creating object of Child
c = Child()
c.greet()     # Accessing method from Parent
c.display()   # Accessing method from Child
