List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)



1. Tuple
Ordered

1.Immutable (cannot be changed after creation)
2.Allows duplicate values
3.Created using round brackets ()

Example:
 my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(my_tuple)
Output:
('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')



2.Set
Unordered

1.Unindexed
2.No duplicate values allowed
3.Created using curly braces {}

Example:
my_set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
print(my_set)




3. Dictionary
1.Used to store key-value pairs
2.Ordered (Python 3.7+), Mutable
3.Created using curly braces {} with colon : separating keys and values

Example:
my_dict = {
    "name": "Ganesh",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "Pune"
}
print(my_dict)
